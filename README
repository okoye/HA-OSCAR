- For System Imager Installation -
Please do this step-by-step.

1. download-packages.sh
	This script will download necessary packages for system imager. I would prefer using apt, but unfortunately system imager has not been on apt yet.

2. packages-install.sh
	This script will install the downloaded packages and some of their dependencies.

3. This step you have to write your phtyon code providing me necessary information via /usr/share/si_config/. The file listed in the si_config directory are:
	
	group_name - The group name of the cluster used in System Imager (SI). Just put anything in it or leave it be (I put ha_group as a default).
	
	ha_eth - The network interface name used for HA (eth0 by default)

	image_dir - The full path of the image directory. By default it is /root/systemimager/images. You can change it to be anything you see fit.

	image_name - The name of the system image. By default, it is ha_image.

	netmask - The network mask (default: 255.255.255.0)

	primary_hostname - The hostname of the primary server

	primary_ip_addr - The IP address of the primary server

	secondary_hostname - The hostname of the secondary server

	secondary_ip_addr - The IP address of the secondary server

	subnet - The subnet 

Please see HA-OSCAR/share/si_config for examples.


4. image-server-steps.sh 
	Once you have all information ready, just call this script INSIDE THE binaries/ DIRECTORY (I need this because of the relative path reference to the configuration files). It will prepare the primary server to be the golden client (i.e. the one being cloned), get the image (from golden client -- which is iteslf), make the primary server to be boot+tftp+dhcp server.

After step 4. You are pretty much done for the primary server. All you have to do is to network boot the secondary server, and let the secondary server fetch an image from the primary server. Then they're done :)



- For filemon -
You don't have to config anything for filemon.pl nor worry about it in installation process. We just have to invoke it as a daemon for file monitoring. To see how-to, just call ./filemon.pl --help.
